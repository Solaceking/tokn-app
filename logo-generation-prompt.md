# TOKN Logo Generation Prompt for AI

## Project Overview
**TOKN** (pronounced "token") is a secure, open-source token and API key manager for developers. It provides AES-256-GCM encryption for storing sensitive API keys and tokens, with features like AI-powered parsing, token testing, team collaboration, and activity tracking.

## Logo Concept Requirements
Create a modern, clean, and professional logo that conveys:
- **Security & Protection** (token/API key management)
- **Developer Tools** (technical audience)
- **Modern Technology** (contemporary design)
- **Simplicity & Elegance** (minimalist approach)

## Style Guidelines
- **Aesthetic**: Modern, geometric, abstract, tech-focused
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: `#FF9F1C` (orange) - current brand color
  - Secondary: `#171717` (dark gray), `#ffffff` (white)
  - Optional accents: `#10b981` (green for security), `#3b82f6` (blue for trust)
- **Typography**: Sans-serif, clean, modern (similar to Inter or JetBrains Mono)
- **Key Words**: Secure, Developer, Token, Encryption, Modern, Clean

## Logo Variations Needed
1. **Primary Logo**: Full "TOKN" wordmark with icon
2. **Icon Only**: Abstract symbol that works at small sizes (favicon, app icon)
3. **Monochrome Versions**: Black/white for different backgrounds
4. **Favicon**: 32x32 and 16x16 pixel versions

## Technical Requirements
- **Format**: Vector (SVG) and raster (PNG) formats
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square or slightly rectangular (icon should work in circles)
- **Scalability**: Must work from 16px to 1024px+
- **Transparency**: PNG with transparent background

## Visual Inspiration
- **Security Elements**: Shields, locks, keys, encryption symbols
- **Developer Elements**: Brackets `{ }`, code symbols `<>`, terminal prompts `$`
- **Token/Key Elements**: Keyholes, puzzle pieces, abstract shapes
- **Modern Tech**: Clean lines, geometric shapes, minimal details

## Detailed Prompt for AI Image Generators

### For Midjourney/DALL-E/Stable Diffusion:

```
Create a modern, minimalist logo for a developer tool called "TOKN" (pronounced "token") - a secure API key and token manager. The logo should convey security, developer tools, and modern technology.

Style: Geometric, abstract, clean lines, minimalist design, tech aesthetic, vector-style, professional

Colors: Primary color #FF9F1C (vibrant orange), with dark gray #171717 and white #ffffff accents. Optional subtle green #10b981 or blue #3b82f6 accents for security/trust elements.

Concept: Combine elements of security (shield, lock, key) with developer tools (brackets, code symbols, terminal). Abstract geometric shapes that suggest protection and encryption.

Requirements:
- Clean, scalable vector design
- Works as both full wordmark "TOKN" and standalone icon
- Modern sans-serif typography for wordmark
- Icon should be recognizable at small sizes (16x16 pixels)
- Professional, trustworthy appearance

Avoid: Cartoonish styles, too many details, cluttered designs, dated aesthetics

Variations needed:
1. Full logo with "TOKN" text and icon
2. Icon only (abstract symbol)
3. Monochrome versions for different backgrounds
4. Favicon versions (16x16, 32x32 pixels)

Technical: SVG vector format, transparent backgrounds, multiple size exports
```

### Specific Icon Ideas to Explore:
1. **Abstract Shield with Brackets**: Shield shape containing stylized `{ }` brackets
2. **Keyhole with Code Symbol**: Keyhole shape formed by `< >` symbols
3. **Lock with Circuit Lines**: Modern lock icon with circuit board patterns
4. **Interlocking Puzzle Pieces**: Abstract puzzle pieces suggesting encryption/security
5. **Geometric Token**: Hexagon or octagon shape with secure elements

### Typography Notes:
- **Font Style**: Modern sans-serif, clean, technical
- **Letter Treatment**: Consider customizing the "O" to incorporate security/icon elements
- **Weight**: Medium to bold for good visibility
- **Spacing**: Tight but readable kerning

## Example Output Description
The final logo should look like something you'd see for a modern developer tool or security product - think 1Password, GitHub, Stripe, or Vercel in terms of professionalism and modern aesthetic. The orange accent color should be used strategically to draw attention to key elements while maintaining an overall professional appearance.

## Usage Contexts
- Website header and favicon
- Mobile and desktop applications
- Documentation site (already using orange accent)
- GitHub repository
- Marketing materials
- App store listings

## Final Checklist
- [ ] Vector SVG file with layers
- [ ] PNG files in multiple sizes (16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024px)
- [ ] Favicon versions (16x16, 32x32)
- [ ] Monochrome black/white versions
- [ ] Documentation with color codes and usage guidelines
- [ ] Brand guidelines document

---

**Note**: The logo should complement the existing documentation site design which already uses `#FF9F1C` as the primary accent color with dark/light theme support. The logo should work well in both color schemes.
